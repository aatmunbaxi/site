  abstract = {This revision of Dummit and Footes widely acclaimed introduction to abstract algebra helps students experience the power and beauty that develops from the rich interplay between different areas of mathematics. The book carefully develops the theory of different algebraic structures, beginning from basic definitions to some in-depth results, using numerous examples and exercises to aid the students understanding. With this approach, students gain an appreciation for how mathematical structures and their interplay lead to powerful results and insights in a number of different settings. The text is designed for a full-year introduction to abstract algebra at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level, but contains substantially more material than would normally be covered in one year. Portions of the book may also be used for various one-semester topics courses in advanced algebra, each of which would provide a solid background for a follow-up course delving more deeply into one of many possible areas: algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, Lie groups, etc.},

  abstract = {Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and biological networks. The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides an introduction to the various category theory ideas employed in topological quantum field theory. These theories are viewed as symmetric monoidal functors from topological cobordism categories into the category of vector spaces. In two dimensions, they are classified by Frobenius algebras. In three dimensions, and under certain conditions, they are classified by modular categories. These are special kinds of categories in which topological notions such as braidings and twists play a prominent role. There is a powerful graphical calculus available for working in such categories, which may be regarded as a generalization of the Feynman diagrams method familiar in physics. This method is introduced and the necessary algebraic structure is graphically motivated step by step. A large subclass of two-dimensional topological field theories can be obtained from a lattice gauge theory construction using triangulations. In these theories, the gauge group is finite. This construction is reviewed, from both the original algebraic perspective as well as using the graphical calculus developed in the earlier chapters. This finite gauge group toy model can be defined in all dimensions, and has a claim to being the simplest non-trivial quantum field theory. We take the opportunity to show explicitly the calculation of the modular category arising from this model in three dimensions, and compare this algebraic data with the corresponding data in two dimensions, computed both geometrically and from triangulations. We use this as an example to introduce the idea of a quantum field theory as producing a tower of algebraic structures, each dimension related to the previous by the process of categorification.},

The authors explain key ideas, including rational equivalence, Chow rings, Schubert calculus and Chern classes, and readers will appreciate the abundant examples, many provided as exercises with solutions available online. Intersection is concerned with the enumeration of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. It has been an active area of mathematics since the work of Leibniz. Chasles' nineteenth-century calculation that there are 3264 smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics was an important landmark, and was the inspiration behind the title of this book. Such computations were motivation for Poincar\'e's development of topology, and for many subsequent theories, so that intersection theory is now a central topic of modern mathematics.},

  abstract = {This book is designed to introduce the reader to the theory of semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, with emphasis on representations. A good knowledge of linear algebra (including eigenvalues, bilinear forms, euclidean spaces, and tensor products of vector spaces) is presupposed, as well as some acquaintance with the methods of abstract algebra. The first four chapters might well be read by a bright undergraduate; however, the remaining three chapters are admittedly a little more demanding. Besides being useful in many parts of mathematics and physics, the theory of semisimple Lie algebras is inherently attractive, combining as it does a certain amount of depth and a satisfying degree of completeness in its basic results. Since Jacobson's book appeared a decade ago, improvements have been made even in the classical parts of the theory. I have tried to incor\- porate some of them here and to provide easier access to the subject for non-specialists. For the specialist, the following features should be noted: (I) The Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of linear transformations is emphasized, with "toral" subalgebras replacing the more traditional Cartan subalgebras in the semisimple case. (2) The conjugacy theorem for Cartan subalgebras is proved (following D. J. Winter and G. D. Mostow) by elementary Lie algebra methods, avoiding the use of algebraic geometry.},
