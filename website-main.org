I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

As a fairly new astrophotographer, these images will be quite poor to the discerning eye. Artifacts like dust spots, field curvature, and star trails can be seen in pretty much all of them, among many more artifacts. Regardless, I find a lot of satisfaction in this hobby as a fascinating blend of science and art.

It's been a while since I took this image, but I belive it total around 3 hours of integration

This image was processed from my first ever outing doing astrophotography. It totals around 12 minutes of integration from the Bortle 1 sky around the McDonald Observatory. Weather prevented any more data collection, but I'm still surprised at how much I was able to get out of it. By contrast my [[*M101: Pinwheel Galaxy][image of M101]] was taken from a very light-polluted Bortle 8 sky, and that image was 3 hours of integration. This image always surprises me at how much better it is to image under dark skies.

The uneven illumination on the bottom left of the image is due to a strange reflection pattern on an IR cut filter I have for my camera. It's not present in other images because I imaged those without the filter.

Here are some of my favorite theorems. Click on the statements for some injected commentary.

*** The Yoneda Lemma
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Let \( \mathsf{C} \) be a locally small category and \( F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \) be a functor. Then
\[
\operatorname*{Hom}(\operatorname*{Hom}(X,-),F) \cong FX
\]
and this isomorphism is natural in both \(X\) and \(F\).
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This theorem is remarkable. The object on the left, as a collection of natural transformations, is seemingly incalculably large. Not only does this theorem tell us that this collection is a set, but it also gives an *explicit description* of these transformations, parameterized by \( FX \). When applied to \( F = \operatorname*{Hom}(Y,-) \) (or more generally representable functors), this theorem gives meaning to the intuitively-known idea that an object is uniquely determined by the maps into (our out of) it.
#+end_details
*** The Tensor-Hom Adjunction
Given an \( (R,S) \)-bimodule \( X \), a right \( R \)-module \( Y \), and left \( S \)-module \( Z \),
\[
\operatorname{Hom}_S( Y \otimes _R X , Z ) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{R}( Y , \operatorname{Hom}_{S}(X,Z))
\]
as abelian groups.
*** Classification of commutative Frobenius algebras by TQFTs
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
For a field \( k \), there is an equivalence of categories \( \mathsf{2TQFT}_k \simeq \mathsf{cFrob}_k \) of 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories and commutative Frobenius algebras.
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This was the first result I learned that expressed how some classical tensor algebras arise as categorical constructions. Essential to this equivalence is the classification of closed 1-dimensional manifolds and how well behaved the category \( \mathsf{2Cob} \) is. A significant amount of work is needed to even hypothesize a higher dimensional analogue. This is the cobordism hypothesis, proposed by Baez and Dolan.
