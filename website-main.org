Currently I am an MS student in mathematics at Texas A&M University.

*Interests:* Broad, includes category theory, functorial quantum field theories, and algebraic geometry.

*Education:*
- PhD Mathematics, Texas A&M University (upcoming)
- MS Mathematics, Texas A&M University (in progess)
- BS Mathematics, UCLA 2021

I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

** Favorite Theorems and Equations

Here are some of my favorite theorems and equations.

*First Isomorphism Theorem:* Let \( A \) be a certain algebraic object (group, ring, module), and \( f : A \to B \) be an algebraic object-homomorphism. Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
A / \ker f \cong \operatorname{im} f.
\end{equation}
/Commentary:/ This theorem is supremely useful. So much so that it feels like half of algebra wouldn't work if it weren't true.

*Yoneda Lemma:* For a locally small category \( \mathcal{C} \) and functor \( F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \),
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Nat}(\operatorname{Hom}(X,-), F) \cong FX
\end{equation}
/Commentary:/ This is an absolutely remarkable theorem. When you think about it, the left side of this isomorphism is an almost incalculable collection of objects. Not only does this theorem say that there are only a set's worth of such natural transformations, but it also gives an *explicit description* of thos natural transformations! When applied to the \( \operatorname{\operatorname{Hom}} \) functor, this gives meaning to the phrase "an object can be completely determined by the maps into/out of it".
