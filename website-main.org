I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

** Favorite Theorems and Equations

Here are some of my favorite theorems and equations. Click on the statements for some injected commentary.

*** The Yoneda Lemma
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Let \( \mathsf{C} \) be a locally small category and \( F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \) be a functor. Then
\[
\operatorname*{Hom}(\operatorname*{Hom}(X,-),F) \cong FX
\]
and this isomorphism is natural in both \(X\) and \(F\).
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This theorem is remarkable. The object on the left, as a collection of natural transformations, is seemingly incalculably large. Not only does this theorem tell us that this collection is a set, but it also gives an *explicit description* of these transformations, parameterized by \( FX \). When applied to \( F = \operatorname*{Hom}(Y,-) \) (or more generally representable functors), this theorem gives meaning to the intuitively-known idea that an object is uniquely determined by the maps into (our out of) it.
#+end_details
*** The Tensor-Hom Adjunction
Given an \( (R,S) \)-bimodule \( X \), a right \( R \)-module \( Y \), and left \( S \)-module \( Z \),
\[
\operatorname{Hom}_S( Y \otimes _R X , Z ) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{R}( Y , \operatorname{Hom}_{S}(X,Z))
\]
as abelian groups.
*** Classification of commutative Frobenius algbebras
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
For a field \( k \), there is an equivalence of categories \( \mathsf{2TQFT}_k \simeq \mathsf{cFrob}_k \) of 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories and commutative Frobenius algebras.
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This was the first result I learned that expressed how some classical tensor algebras arise as categorical constructions. Essential to this equivalence is the classification of closed 1-dimensional manifolds and how well behaved the category \( \mathsf{2Cob} \) is. A significant amount of work is needed to even hypothesize a higher dimensional analogue. This is the cobordism hypothesis, proposed by Baez and Dolan.
