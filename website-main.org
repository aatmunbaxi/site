Currently I am an MS student in mathematics at Texas A&M University.

*Interests:* Broad. Some include category theory, topological quantum field theories, and algebraic geometry.

*Education:*
- MS Mathematics, Texas A&M University (in progess)
- PhD Mathematics, Texas A&M (upcoming)
- BS Mathematics, UCLA 2021

I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

Here are some of my favorite theorems and equations.

*Yoneda Lemma:* For a locally small category \( \mathcal{C} \) and functor \( F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \),
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Nat}(\operatorname{Hom}(X,-), F) \cong FX
\end{equation}
