I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

** Emacs =org-mode= for LaTeX :emacs:org:hobby:productivity:

:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: computing
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: emacs-to-type-LaTeX
:END:
About four years ago, my brother introduced me to Linux and free and open source software.
Around the same time I learned to use LaTeX to typeset documents with lots of mathematical notation.
I then stumbled across Gilles Castel's [[https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/][article on typing LaTeX with vim]], and I was amazed.

For those who don't know, typing LaTeX by default is a terrible experience.
/Terrible./
Using a program like vim with plugins made typing LaTeX so frictionless that I immediately dove into the world of extensible text editors.
I got more than I bargained for, but the payoff of effortless typesetting of math drove me to stick with it.
I finally replicated most of Castel's setup, and thought I had seen it all.

Then I found emacs org-mode.

GNU Emacs [is] a sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating system, and the International Space Station.

---Steve Yegge
#+end_quote
#+end_aside
Vim, the program I had been using for easy LaTeX input, has had a longstanding "rivalry" with another editor called GNU Emacs.
Since spending time with both programs, I've found this "rivalry" a bit silly.
Vim and emacs are different programs designed with different use cases in mind with different philosophies.
They just /happen/ to both be text editors.
Comparing vim and emacs is a bit like comparing a bicycle to a tank simply because they can move people around quicker than by foot.

In any case, what brought me to emacs was org-mode.
Org-mode is a major mode of emacs, encompassing everything from marking up basic text files and exporting to PDF, keeping an agenda, and literally everything else you could imagine needing when it comes to typing documents of any sort.
Many think of it as souped-up markdown, but this is a disservice to its utility.
It's so powerful, I could probably find a way to make it do my laundry[fn:1].

What initially drove me to org-mode was the function =org-latex-preview=.
In contrast to vim, emacs is a graphical program, which allows the program to /display images of compiled LaTeX over the text buffer you're editing./
Let's see what that looks like.

Org-mode is plaintext, so the raw text file you're editing might look something like this.

#+begin_example
**Hermitian Metrics
We'd like an analogue of Riemannian manifolds but "complexified".
Recall that a metric \( g \) is a \( 2\times 2 \) symmetric matrix at a point.
The complex analogue of "symmetric" is Hermitian, which motivates the following definition:

*Definition:* A /Hermitian metric/ on a complex manifold with local coordinates \( (z^1,\ldots , z^m) \) is a tensor field
\begin{equation*}
h_{j \overline{k}} dz^j\otimes dz^{\overline{k}}
\end{equation*}
where \( h_{j \overline{k}} \) varies smoothly, and is positive definite and Hermitian at each point \( z \).
The form
\begin{equation*}
\omega = \frac{i}{2} h_{j \overline{k}} dz^j\wedge dz^{\overline{k}}
\end{equation*}
is called the /Kahler form/ of the metric.
A complex manifold with a Hermitian metric is called a /Hermitian manifold/.
#+end_example

Here is this same snippet of text, but viewed in emacs, with all the org goodies activated.
[[~/Pictures/website/org-latex-goodies-ex.png]]

Notice how the compiled LaTeX appears inline, and the font size is variable for the heading.
These inline LaTeX previews are what pulled me to org-mode, and with the help of some third party programs like =xenops-mode=[fn:2], these previews render asynchronously as I continue typing.

There are many moving parts to this puzzle, but videos speak louder than words, so here is a quick demo.
#+caption: Sped up 30%
[[~/Videos/emacs-math-demo.gif]]

I could write more about how I achieved this setup, but others that are much smarter than me already have.


[fn:1] My [[*My DOOM Emacs Configuration][DOOM Emacs Config]] is typed in org-mode thanks to its literate programming abilities. In fact, this entire website is just one big org-mode file.

[fn:2] With org version 9.7, =xenops-mode= will be wholly unnecessary thanks to a new default =org-latex-preview= function. See a demo [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AfvuV-bYo&t=376s][here]].

** Declarative Programming for UltraFast™ Brain-to-Binary
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: computing
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: brain_to_binary_bliss_of_decla_prog
:END:
Recently I've been messing around with different programming languages and branching out beyond the C-style languages I know like C++ and Python.
In my search for one to try out, I discovered Haskell, and the paradigm of functional programming as a whole.

As a mathematician by trade, the usefulness of programming was never lost on me.
From my time with C++ and Python, I had developed a (not unreasonable) notion that programming was all about telling computers how to do something you want done..
This changed when I learned of the functional programming paradigm, or more generally, declarative-style languages.

Suppose we wanted to write a function =fun= that takes in a non-negative integer and returns the sum of squares of numbers between 0 and that integer.
In fancy math language, the function would look like this:
\begin{align*}
\mathtt{fun} : \mathbf{Z}_{ \geqslant 0} &\to \mathbf{Z}_{\geqslant 0} \\
                                \mathtt{fun}(k)       &= \sum_{i=1}^k i^2.
\end{align*}

Let's implement this in Python with an imperative style of writing:
#+begin_src python
def fun(k):
    num = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        num += i**2
    return i
#+end_src
We're telling the computer here to step through all non-negative integers up to =k= and adding the square of these integers to a cumulative sum of all the previous numbers.
Perfectly intuitive and reasonable.

Let's implement this in Haskell, a more-or-less pure functional programming language with a highly expressive, declarative style of syntax:
#+begin_src haskell
fun k = sum [i*i | i <- [0..k]]
#+end_src
This solution is elegant once you know that the =<-= syntax is the set containment symbol \( \in \) from mathematics.

This declarative style of writing code is something I find myself coming back to whenever I want to quickly hack an idea together.
It lets me focus on implementing the key steps of the problem I have laid out, without getting bogged down with more minor details of how it should be solved.
Focusing on the /what/ and not the /how/ is a fast-track to getting a compiled program that does what you want it to do quickly.

Of course, this type of programming is not without faults.
For one, you are leaving the "how" up to compiler with how it implements the expressive syntax.
Compiler engineers and developers for the languages are a clever bunch, but if you want more fine-grain control, the imperative style is superior.

Another drawback to the declarative style is working on large projects with many developers.
Since declarative programs tend to read closer to natural language, it's possible that each developer will craft their own dialect within the confines of the syntax.
Having several people with several dialects working on a single project can be a challenge.
Oftentimes for the sake of team cohesion and ease of debugging, a unified style-guide for large projects is preferred.

Despite this, I will continue to prefer declarative programming for quick implementations, only moving to imperative when I think more control is needed.

As a fairly new astrophotographer, these images will be quite poor to the discerning eye. Artifacts like dust spots, field curvature, and star trails can be seen in pretty much all of them, among many more artifacts. Regardless, I find a lot of satisfaction in this hobby as a fascinating blend of science and art.

This image was processed from my first ever outing doing astrophotography. It totals around 12 minutes of integration from the Bortle 1 sky around the McDonald Observatory. Weather prevented any more data collection, but I'm still surprised at how much I was able to get out of it. By contrast my [[*M101: Pinwheel Galaxy][image of M101]] was taken from a very light-polluted Bortle 8 sky, and that image was 3 hours of integration. This image always surprises me at how much better it is to image under dark skies.

The uneven illumination on the bottom left of the image is due to a strange reflection pattern on an IR cut filter I have for my camera. It's not present in other images because I imaged those without the filter.

Here are some of my favorite theorems. Click on the statements for some commentary.

*** The Yoneda Lemma
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Let \( \mathsf{C} \) be a locally small category and \( F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \) be a functor. Then
\[
\operatorname*{Hom}(\operatorname*{Hom}(X,-),F) \cong FX
\]
and this isomorphism is natural in both \(X\) and \(F\).
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This theorem is remarkable. The object on the left, as a collection of natural transformations, is seemingly incalculably large. Not only does this theorem tell us that this collection is a set, but it also gives an *explicit description* of these transformations, parameterized by \( FX \). When applied to \( F = \operatorname*{Hom}(Y,-) \) (or more generally representable functors), this theorem gives meaning to the intuitively-known idea that an object is uniquely determined by the maps into (our out of) it.
#+end_details
*** The Tensor-Hom Adjunction
Given an \( (R,S) \)-bimodule \( X \), a right \( R \)-module \( Y \), and left \( S \)-module \( Z \),
\[
\operatorname{Hom}_S( Y \otimes _R X , Z ) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{R}( Y , \operatorname{Hom}_{S}(X,Z))
\]
as abelian groups.
*** Classification of commutative Frobenius algebras by TQFTs
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
For a field \( k \), there is an equivalence of categories \( \mathsf{2TQFT}_k \simeq \mathsf{cFrob}_k \) of 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories and commutative Frobenius algebras.
#+end_summary

*Comments:* This was the first result I learned that expressed how some classical tensor algebras arise as categorical constructions. Essential to this equivalence is the classification of closed 1-dimensional manifolds and how well behaved the category \( \mathsf{2Cob} \) is. A significant amount of work is needed to even hypothesize a higher dimensional analogue. This is the cobordism hypothesis, proposed by Baez and Dolan.
