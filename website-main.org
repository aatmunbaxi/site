Currently I am an MS student in mathematics at Texas A&M University.

*Interests:* Broad, includes category theory, functorial quantum field theories, and algebraic geometry.

*** What I'm Reading
- /Basic Algebraic Geometry 2/ [[cite:&shafarevichBasicAlgebraicGeometry2013]]
  - For reference, Algebraic Geometry [[cite:&hartshorneAlgebraicGeometry1977]] and The Rising Sea [[cite:&vakilRisingSea2017]]
- /Tensor Categories/ [[cite:&etingofTensorCategories2015]]
*** Education
- PhD Mathematics, Texas A&M University (upcoming)
- MS Mathematics, Texas A&M University (in progess)
- BS Mathematics, UCLA 2021

*** Hobbies
- Soccer. Specifically, Liverpool FC
- Astrophotography. Check my images [[*Astrophotos][here]]
- Learning japanese through immersion

I've spent a lot of time developing a workflow that works well for me, mainly centered around my time typesetting math, and finding better ways to do so.
Here I record some things that I've learned along the way.

** Favorite Theorems and Equations

Here are some of my favorite theorems and equations.

*** First Isomorphism Theorems
Let \( A \) be a certain algebraic object (group, ring, module), and \( f : A \to B \) be an algebraic object-homomorphism. Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
A / \ker f \cong \operatorname{im} f.
\end{equation}
- /Commentary:/ This theorem is supremely useful. So much so that it feels like half of algebra wouldn't work if it weren't true.

*** The Yoneda Lemma
Let \( \mathsf{C} \) be a locally small category and \( F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Set} \) be a functor, then
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Hom}(\operatorname{Hom}(X,-), F) \cong FX
\end{equation}
and is natural in both \( X \) and \( F \).
- /Commentary:/ This is an absolutely remarkable theorem. When you think about it, the left side of this isomorphism is an almost incalculable collection of objects. Not only does this theorem say that there are only a set's worth of such natural transformations, but it also gives an *explicit description* of those natural transformations! When applied to the \( \operatorname{\operatorname{Hom}} \) functor, this gives meaning to the phrase "an object can be completely determined by the maps into/out of it".
