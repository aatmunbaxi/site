I came across the phrase「氷が行かなくなってきている」in an episode of Jojo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure and couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at it.
The morphology of Japanese words is a fascinating one, and this sentence exemplifies it brilliantly.
Roughly, this sentence says &ldquo;the ice is becoming ineffective&rdquo;, or more naturally, &ldquo;the ice is becoming less effective&rdquo;.
The first word 「氷」, is straightforward; it means &ldquo;ice&rdquo;.
The particle 「が」 is an indicative particle meant to direct the attention of the listener to the noun it is attached to.

Now here comes the interesting part: the final 「効かなくなってきている」.
The base of this phrase is 「効く」, which means &ldquo;to be effective, to function, to work&rdquo;.
From here, the verb is morphed to its negative 「効かない」.
Of course, this means &ldquo;to not be effective&rdquo;.
One cool things about Japanese is that most words that end in 「い」morph like 「ーい」adjectives.
One such way 「ーい」adjective morph is by replacing the い with く.
This morph is typically described as turning the adjective into an adverb, but the idea of turning a negative-conjugated verb into an adverb is a bit mysterious, especially since no such pattern exists in english.
Now we&rsquo;re left with 「効かなく」.

Now that we have an &ldquo;adverb&rdquo;, we need a verb for it to describe.
This is where 「なる」comes in.
The entire last part 「なってきている」is a morph of this verb, which means &ldquo;to become&rdquo;.
「なる」 becomes 「なって」, which is a special morph (called -te form) of verbs that can set up a number of new morphs.
From here we add the verb 「来る」, which means &ldquo;to come to be&rdquo;.
From 「なって来る」 we then turn the 「来る」 into _its_ -te form, yielding 「なってきて」.
(It&rsquo;s worth nothing that this construction is usually written in kana, hence I drop the kanji.)
The final addition is the verb 「いる」.
When this verb is added to the -te form of another verb, it expresses an enduring state of action.
Oftentimes this translated to the present progressive form in english, e.g. run -&gt; _running_.

So we&rsquo;re left with 「なってきている」, which roughly means &ldquo;is becoming&rdquo;.
The nuance of the 「きて」 is sadly lost since there is no real way to directly translate this to english.

When I first heard this sentence it took me some seconds to parse.
As an english native speaker, I&rsquo;m not used to having to listen this long to a single phrase to glean its meaning.
Let&rsquo;s take a different approach to illustrate how long words can be constructed.

Remember the 「ーい」 adjective morphs I mentioned?
It turns out that the negative of an 「ーい」 adjective is also an 「ーい」 adjective!
As such, there is theoretically **no upper bound to how long of a &ldquo;word&rdquo; you can grammatically correctly construct in Japanese**.

The construction is simple: take an 「ーい」 adjective and negate it.
The way to do this is change the final 「い」 to 「くない」.
Repeat.
For example with the word 「よい」, meaning &ldquo;good&rdquo;, we can negate it twice to the word meaning &ldquo;not not good&rdquo;:

```text
よい ー> よくない ー> よくなくない
```

But the final word here is also an 「ーい」 adjective.
This means that this is also a grammatically correct construction:

```text
よくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくなくない
```

Repeat as needed to construct as long of a word as you want.
Of course, we&rsquo;ve long left the issue of pragmatism behind, but still, it&rsquo;s pretty not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not cool, huh?
