      <description>As a fairly new astrophotographer, these images will be quite poor to the discerning eye. Artifacts like dust spots, field curvature, and star trails can be seen in pretty much all of them, among many more artifacts. Regardless, I find a lot of satisfaction in this hobby as a fascinating blend of science and art.

Details Itâ€™s been a while since I took this image, but I belive it total around 3 hours of integration</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Table of Contents Modular categories are not determined by their modular data Classification of commutative Frobenius algebras by TQFTs The Yoneda Lemma Modular categories are not determined by their modular data A modular category \( \mathcal{C} \) is not determined by its \( S \) and \( T \) matrices. Comments: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Classification of commutative Frobenius algebras by TQFTs For a field \( k \), there is an equivalence of categories \( \mathsf{2TQFT}_k \simeq \mathsf{cFrob}_k \) of 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories and commutative Frobenius algebras.</description>
