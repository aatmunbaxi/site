<p>This image was processed from my first ever outing doing astrophotography. It totals around 12 minutes of integration from the Bortle 1 sky around the McDonald Observatory. Weather prevented any more data collection, but I’m still surprised at how much I was able to get out of it. By contrast my <a href="#m101-pinwheel-galaxy">image of M101</a> was taken from a very light-polluted Bortle 8 sky, and that image was 3 hours of integration. This image always surprises me at how much better it is to image under dark skies.</p>
<p>The uneven illumination on the bottom left of the image is due to a strange reflection pattern on an IR cut filter I have for my camera. It’s not present in other images because I imaged those without the filter.</p>
