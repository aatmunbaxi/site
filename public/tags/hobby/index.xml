      <description>As a fairly new astrophotographer, these images will be quite poor to the discerning eye. Artifacts like dust spots, field curvature, and star trails can be seen in pretty much all of them, among many more artifacts. Regardless, I find a lot of satisfaction in this hobby as a fascinating blend of science and art.&#xA;M101: Pinwheel Galaxy Figure 1: M101, The Pinwheel Galaxy&#xA;Details It’s been a while since I took this image, but I belive it total around 3 hours of integration</description>

      <description>About four years ago, my brother introduced me to Linux and free and open source software. Around the same time I learned to use LaTeX to typeset documents with lots of mathematical notation. I then stumbled across Gilles Castel’s article on typing LaTeX with vim, and I was amazed.&#xA;For those who don’t know, typing LaTeX by default is a terrible experience. Terrible. Using a program like vim with plugins made typing LaTeX so frictionless that I immediately dove into the world of extensible text editors.</description>
